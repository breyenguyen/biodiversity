# Biodiversity of US National Parks

This project is part of Codecademy Data Science Career Path and inspired by a short report by Noah Snizik. In this project, I analyzed data from 56 US national parks to measure the species richness and conducted some hypothesis tests on the association between variables.

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and contributed by National Park Service. It provides information on the presence and status of species in our national parks.
